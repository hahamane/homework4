Continuous Integration
Continuous Integration is the process of automating the build and testing of code every time a team member commits changes to version control. 
The process of the CI is to have developers to upload changes of the program, codes etc. to shared repository, which would automatically build and test the change to validate the change. 
This shared depository will continuously test and integrate the changes to the main code.
